# Theory of Algorithms
This repository contains exercises as part of my course for the module Theory of Algorithms. This module focused on functional programming and all exercises were completed using [Racket programming language](https://racket-lang.org/).   

## What is Functional Programming?
Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

## What is Racket?
Racket is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.

## How to Run:
1. Download Racket [here](http://racket-lang.org/download/).
2. Download repository or clone `https://github.com/DarrenFitz/TheoryOfAlgorithms`.
3. Open DrRacket, open any .rkt file and run `Ctrl + R`
