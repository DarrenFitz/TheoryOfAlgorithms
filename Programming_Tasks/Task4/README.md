## Task 4

4. Write a function sublsum in Racket that takes a list (of integers) as input and returns
a list of sublists of it that sum to zero. For this problem, you can use the
combinations built-in function. Note the order of the sublists and their elements
doesnâ€™t matter 

**Example:**
(sublsum (list 1 2 3 4 -5))

**Result:**
'((2 3 -5) (-5 1 4))


### Combinations Function? 
Return a list of all combinations of elements in the input list (aka the powerset of lst). If size is given, limit results to combinations of size elements.


### Solution
```Racket
;mySum Function
;used to sum elements in each sublist
(define (mySum l)
 (if(null? l) 0
   (+ (car l)(mySum (cdr l)))))

;sublsum Function
;finds any sublist that sum to zero and outputs them
(define (sublsum l)
  (for ([i (combinations l)])
    (if (= (mySum i) 0)
        (println i)
        '()
    )))

```
